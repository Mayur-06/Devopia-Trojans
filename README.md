# Drone Based Delivery System


## Overview
This project aims to design and develop a drone-based delivery system tailored specifically for the demanding terrain, low network connectivity, and unpredictable weather conditions prevalent in Sikkim, India. Our system ensures the timely and efficient delivery of essential supplies such as medicines and food to remote regions, overcoming the logistical challenges posed by the region's geographical landscape.

## Features
- **Optimized Route Implementation**: We have implemented an optimized route feature that allows the drone to identify the most efficient delivery route. This feature ensures that deliveries are made in the shortest possible time while conserving energy and resources.

- **Utilization of Last-Mile Fleet Solution**: Our system leverages the Google Routes API to optimize routes through a last-mile fleet solution. By integrating this API, we ensure that the drone follows the most optimized path from the starting point to the destination, taking into account various factors such as traffic conditions and terrain obstacles.

- **User Interface**: We have developed a user-friendly interface that facilitates easy navigation, real-time tracking, and dynamic delivery point adjustment. This interface enhances the overall user experience for both operators and recipients, making the system accessible and intuitive to use.

## Demonstration
To provide evidence of our drone-based delivery system's functionality, we have included a simulation video showcasing the drone in action. This video demonstrates how the drone navigates through challenging terrains and adapts to dynamic weather conditions to ensure uninterrupted delivery.

## Contributions
- **Research and UI Development**: Souptik Taran, Mayur K T, and Girish Sharma contributed to the research work and the development of the user interface for the map, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for users.

- **Simulation Development**: Om Gupta utilized Unreal Engine and Blender to create the simulation video showcasing the drone's functionality. His expertise in simulation development added a visual dimension to our project, providing clear evidence of our system's capabilities.

## Conclusion
Our drone-based delivery system demonstrates technical resilience, showcasing robustness in navigating through challenging terrains and adapting to dynamic weather conditions. Leveraging route optimization algorithms through open-source APIs, our system ensures precision navigation, enabling efficient and accurate delivery operations to remote and inaccessible areas. With its user-friendly interface and advanced features, our system enhances accessibility and usability for operators and recipients alike, addressing the logistical challenges posed by Sikkim's geographical landscape.

## Recognition
